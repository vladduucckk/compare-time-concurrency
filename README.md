# compare-time-concurrency
This Python script benchmarks four different methods of making HTTP requests to a test URL. The objective is to compare the performance of each approach in terms of execution time while handling possible exceptions.

# HTTP Requests Performance Comparison

This project is a Python script that compares the performance of different modes of making HTTP requests to a specified URL using the `requests`, `aiohttp`, and concurrency libraries. The main goal is to illustrate the differences in execution time between synchronous, asynchronous, multithreaded, and multiprocess approaches.

## Features

- **Synchronous Requests**: Executes requests in a blocking manner, waiting for each request to complete before proceeding to the next.
- **Multithreaded Requests**: Uses threading to handle multiple requests concurrently, allowing some degree of overlap in execution.
- **Multiprocess Requests**: Utilizes multiple processes to execute requests, bypassing the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) and potentially improving performance on CPU-bound tasks.
- **Asynchronous Requests**: Implements asynchronous programming with `aiohttp`, enabling efficient handling of multiple requests without blocking.

## Requirements

Make sure to install the required packages before running the script. You can do this by running:

---
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
---


## Performance Summary

	•	Synchronous Mode:
	•	Execution Time: X seconds (replace with actual time)
	•	This mode is the simplest but can be significantly slower when handling multiple requests, as it waits for each one to complete.
	•	Multithreaded Mode:
	•	Execution Time: Y seconds (replace with actual time)
	•	Offers better performance than synchronous execution, as it allows multiple requests to be in flight simultaneously.
	•	Multiprocess Mode:
	•	Execution Time: Z seconds (replace with actual time)
	•	Can provide significant speed improvements for CPU-bound tasks, as it runs requests in separate processes, avoiding GIL limitations.
	•	Asynchronous Mode:
	•	Execution Time: W seconds (replace with actual time)
	•	Typically the fastest approach for I/O-bound tasks, allowing for many concurrent requests without the overhead of threading or multiprocessing.

## Conclusion

The results highlight the advantages of asynchronous programming for I/O-bound tasks like HTTP requests. Depending on your specific use case (CPU-bound vs. I/O-bound), you can choose the most suitable approach to optimize performance.
